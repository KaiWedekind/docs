## What is Heavy?
Heavy is a framework for easily generating audio plugins for use in interactive sound and music applications such games, instruments or installations.

Developed from the ground up, Heavy takes advantage of modern software principles to generate highly optimised code suitable for use on a wide variety hardware architectures and software frameworks.

One of the main aims of Heavy is to reduce the dependency on low-level programming from a creative standpoint and bridge the gap from idea to implementation.

## Pure Data
[Pure Data](http://msp.ucsd.edu/software.html) is a visual programming environment for real-time time audio and music creation.

Heavy can interpret and convert a certain subset of features from Pure Data patches.

A full list of all the supported Pd objects can be found [here](https://enzienaudio.com/docs/pdobjects.html).

## Optimisations

Heavy generated code comes pre-optimisated for architectures that can take advantage of AVX, SSE or NEON instructions. For more bespoke platforms Heavy also provides a basic implementation that can perform as low as single sample processing blocks.
