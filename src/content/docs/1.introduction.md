## What is Heavy?
Heavy is a framework for easily generating audio plugins for use in interactive sound and music applications such games, instruments or installations.

It aims to reduce the dependency on low-level programming from a creative standpoint and bridge the gap from idea to production-ready implementation.

Heavy makes use of modern software principles to generate highly optimised code suitable for use on a wide variety hardware architectures and software frameworks.

## What is Pure Data?
[Pure Data](http://msp.ucsd.edu/software.html) (Pd) is a visual programming environment for real-time time audio and music creation.

Heavy can interpret and convert a certain set of features from Pure Data patches.

A full list of all the supported Pd objects can be found [here](https://enzienaudio.com/docs/pdobjects.html).

## Supported Platforms
* Windows 8, 10 and WSA
* Mac OSX

## Supported Frameworks
* Unity 5
* VST
* Wwise
* Pd external
* Web Audio API

## Optimisations
Heavy-generated code comes pre-optimised for architectures that can take advantage of AVX, SSE or NEON instructions. For more bespoke platforms, Heavy also provides a basic implementation supporting single sample block sizes.
