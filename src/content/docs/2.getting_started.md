#Â Getting Started
---

The typical workflow of using heavy begins by creating patches that represent individual audio assets to be integrated into your application.

Pd files describing the asset can be uploaded to generate output targets for downloading and integrating into the supported platforms.

Plugin binaries are even compiled on our servers so most of the heavy lifting is already done.

## Creating Patches
Once you've [created an account](http://enzienaudio.com/login), you'll be presented with the profile page for managing your user settings and patches.

From here, patches can be added by entering a new name and clicking `+ New Patch`.

## Uploading

### Single files
Within the patch page, files can be uploaded to the server via the browser. Drag a file from your desktop to the `Choose File` button and click `Compile` to generate the targets.

Previous compiles are always tracked so checking out previous revisions is easy. This also means all assets available through Heavy have their own unique URL.

### Folders

Additionally there are situations where it is necessary to provide a directory of files to help organise the patches. An archive (`.zip`) can be uploaded that contains all assets required.

Heavy will look for a file called `_main.pd` that should exist in the top-level heirachy. Aside from that, all other files can be located anywhere as long as it has a relative reference to this main file.

Once zipped, upload the archive like any normal file to the web interface.

### Scripting

For efficiency reasons a command-line script is available to automate the process of uploading patches, compiling and downloading targets. See the [Uploader Documentation](#3.uploader#getting-started) for more information.

## Using the Generated Targets

Each compile result will show a comprehensive list of targets available to download. Some of these might be created dynamically upon request, but once generated will be cached.

Typically heavy provides ready made binaries for Windows 32bit, Windows 64bit, OSX 64bit, iOS and Javascript. Although source code is also provided that includes Xcode and Visual Studio 2015 projects as a convenience. Heavy uses these same projects to generate the binaries.

## Audio Input/Output
To receive audio input into your patch add an `[adc~]` object.

To send audio output add an `[dac~]`, the number of channels can be configured by providing arguments to object. For example `[dac~ 1 2 3]` will generate 3 channels.

## Exposing Parameters
All (control) `[receive]` and `[r]` objects annotated with `@hv_param` will be exposed as parameters in the framework. The name provided will propagate through to the plugin interface.

For example, `[r gain @hv_param 0 1 0.5]` will show up as "gain", with a minimum value of 0, a maximum value of 1, and a default value of 0.5.

Receivers not annotated with `@hv_param` are still completely functional, they simply will not be exported to the framework interface.

## Errors
If there's an incompatibility within the patch, Heavy will generate an error message.

## Warnings
Heavy will also perform patch analysis to look for common mistakes and inconsitencies between Pd and heavy behaviour. The targets will still be generated correctly but it might be useful information for example when cleaning up the patch.
