#Â Getting Started

## Typical Workflow
The typical Heavy workflow begins with designing a source or effect using Pure Data, uploading the Pd patch to the Heavy Cloud, and downloading result, be it source code or a precompiled binary. Each patch has its own page which tracks all previous compiles. As such, all products available through Heavy have their URL. It is a goal of Heavy to not only produce fast signal processing code, but also to be easily integrateable into any existing workflow.

## Exposing Parameters
All (control) `[receive]` and `[r]` objects annotated with `@hv_param` will be exposed as parameters in the framework. The name provided will propagate through to the plugin interface. For example, `[r gain @hv_param 0 1 0.5]` will show up as "gain", with a minimum value of 0, a maximum value of 1, and a default value of 0.5.

Receivers not annotated with `@hv_param` are still completely functional, they simply will not be exported to the framework interface.

## Manually Compiling
While the Heavy platform always offers precompiled binaries for all supported frameworks, source code is also provided. The source code generally also includes Xcode and Visual Studio 2015 projects as a convenience. Heavy uses these same projects to generate the binaries.
