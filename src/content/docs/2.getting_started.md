## Typical Workflow
Upload your patch to the server.

## Converting a Pd patch

## Using the Generated Targets

## Exposing Parameters

## Errors
If there's an incompatibility within the patch, heavy will generate an error message.

## Warnings
heavy will also perform patch analysis to look for common mistakes and inconsitencies between Pd and heavy behaviour. The targets will still be generated correctly but it might be useful information for example when cleaning up the patch.

## Manually Compiling
While the Heavy platform always offers precompiled binaries for all supported frameworks, source code is also provided. The source code generally also includes Xcode and Visual Studio 2015 projects as a convenience. Heavy uses these same projects to generate the binaries.
