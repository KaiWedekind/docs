# Fabric
---

[Fabric](http://www.tazman-audio.co.uk) is a powerful Unity-based audio middleware solution extending the features available and providing custom user interfaces.

Heavy can generate Fabric specific DSP plugins for a variety of use cases, including sound generators, effects units and continuous or one-shot style sounds.

## Getting Started

Create a new Unity project, or start with an existing one.

The main Fabric application can be downloaded [here](http://www.tazman-audio.co.uk), and simply be installed by dragging it into the project. Or through the Unity menu: 
    `Assets > Import Package > Custom Package > select Fabric .unitypackage`

In addition, patch management and generation is handled by the Fabric Heavy Uploader Plugin available [here](http://www.tazman-audio.co.uk). Again install this package into the Unity project.

## Fabric Heavy Uploader

Don't want to manually organise patches and plugin scripts and binaries in your projects? The `Fabric Heavy Uploader` is made for you!

Once installed the uploader window can be accessed through the menu:
    `Window > Fabric > Heavy Uploader`

## Tokens

In order to authenticate with **heavy** a user token will need to be generated and stored in the `Fabric Heavy Uploader`.

When logged into [**heavy**](https://enzienaudio.com/login), go to your user settings page. Under the `API tokens` section click the `Generate` button and copy the text under the token heading. Paste this token text into the `Token` field in `Fabric Heavy Uploader`.

## Creating a new patch

* Note: Currently it is neccessary to first create a new patch on the **heavy** site.

Then in your Assets folder create a directory that contains the new patch. The name of the folder will be the name that the `Fabric Heavy Uploader` will reference when uploading to the **heavy** server. Make sure it is the same as the one pre-created on the site.

The minimum requirement is to have a patch named `_main.pd`, this will be used as the top-level reference. Other patch abstractions and files can also be included in this directory.

See the image below as an example:

## Generating a DSP plugin

After following the previous steps, in the `Fabric Heavy Uploader` window select the appropriate `Build` option to generate and hit `Upload`.

The plugin assets will be automatically managed.

## Using a DSP plugin

### Basic Fabric Initialisation

For a quick Fabric setup follow these instructions:

* Create a Fabric Manager (`Fabric > FabricManager`)
* Click the Fabric Manager object and add an Event to the Event Manager, for example 'Test'.
* Create a separate empty gameobject in the top-level scene hierarchy.
* Add a `Fabric Event Trigger` and set the name to 'Test'.
* Make sure the Fabric Manager is selected.
* Add the DSP plugin `(Fabric > Components > Heavy > *patch name*)`
* Select the newly added DSP plugin object.
* Add a `Fabric Event Listener` and set the name to 'Test'.
* Press play in Unity.

## Plugin Types

The type of plugin that **heavy** generates is dynamically determined depending on the [I/O channel configuration](#02.getting_started#audio-input-output).

### Generator

A patch that __doesn't__ contain an `[adc~]` will result in a `Generator` unit being created (i.e. a simple sinewave or synth). This only outputs audio an audio signal.

### Effect

If an `[adc~]` object exists in the patch the generated plugin with be an `Effect` unit, for processing input audio sources (i.e. a filter, compressor, distortion fx).

* Note: make sure that the corresponding AudioSource component's AudioClip property is set to Null.

## Playback Types

Typically in sample-based approaches, sounds can be categorised roughly as either being a one-shot or a continuous loop. This playback behaviour can be similarly recreated with **heavy**.

### Continuous 

By default, once a plugin is triggered to start via a Fabric Event it will continue with an infinite duration until given a Stop command.

### One-shots

However, the patch itself can instruct Fabric to stop itself from playing and remove it from the playback pool.

First make sure that within the Fabric Manager object, the AudioSource Pool's `Size` property is set to a non-zero number.

Then at any point you can send a `bang` message to a `[send finished]` object in the patch, which will then instruct Fabric to stop playback.

The example patch below will play a sinewave sound for 2 seconds before ending:
