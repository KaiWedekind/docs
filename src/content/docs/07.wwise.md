## RTPCs
Each [exposed parameter](#02.getting_started#exposing-parameters) will automatically generate a parameter in the Wwise plugin interface that can be connected to RTPCs from your game.

## Source Generator or FX Unit

The type of plugin that **heavy** generates is dynamically determined depending on the [I/O channel configuration](#02.getting_started#audio-input-output).

If an `[adc~]` object exists in the patch the generated plugin with be an FX unit. Otherwise it'll be a source generator plugin.

Make sure your I/O configurations are equal, i.e. mono input -> mono output, or stereo -> stereo.

## Plugin Assets

### Authoring
The Authoring plugin is what shows up in the Wwise Authoring interface, you can assign this plugin to Sound SFX objects and hook up RTPCs to its parameters.

### Runtime
The runtime components are used by the Wwise integration engine, these are the files that will be actually used by your game or application. We provide both a dynamic plugin that can be easily loaded into development engines like Unity and Unreal, as well a static library that can be compiled directly into the Wwise Integration.

## Authoring Plugin Installation

### Windows Authoring 32bit
Take the following files found in the `Wwise Win32` target:

* `HV_{PATCH_NAME}_WwiseSourceAuthPlugin.dll`
* `HV_{PATCH_NAME}_WwiseSourceAuthPlugin.xml`

And place them in the following location:

* `C:\Program Files (x86)\Audiokinetic\Wwise 2016.1.0.5775\Authoring\Win32\Release\bin\plugins`

### Windows Authoring 64bit
Take the following files found in the `Wwise Win64` target:

* `HV_{PATCH_NAME}_WwiseSourceAuthPlugin.dll`
* `HV_{PATCH_NAME}_WwiseSourceAuthPlugin.xml`

And place them in one of the following locations:

* `C:\Program Files (x86)\Audiokinetic\Wwise 2016.1.0.5775\Authoring\x64\Release\bin\plugins`


### Mac OSX Authoring
The Wwise Authoring application for Mac OSX uses a Wine wrapper and therefore requires plugin binaries compiled for Windows.

Take the following files found in the `Wwise Win32` target:

* `HV_{PATCH_NAME}_WwiseSourceAuthPlugin.dll`
* `HV_{PATCH_NAME}_WwiseSourceAuthPlugin.xml`

And place them in the following location:

* `/Applications/Audiokinetic/Wwise 2016.1.0.5775/Wwise.app/Contents/SharedSupport/Wwise2016/support/wwise/drive_c/Program Files/Audiokinetic/Wwise/Authoring/Win32/Release/bin/plugins/`

After installing the plugins the Wine cache will need to be refreshed, in a command-line application like Terminal run the following commands:

```
cd "/Applications/Audiokinetic/Wwise 2016.1.0.5775/Wwise.app/Contents/SharedSupport/Wwise2016/"
```

```
CX_ROOT="/Applications/Audiokinetic/Wwise 2016.1.0.5775/Wwise.app/Contents/SharedSupport/Wwise2016/" WINEPREFIX="/Applications/Audiokinetic/Wwise 2016.1.0.5775/Wwise.app/Contents/SharedSupport/Wwise2016/support/wwise/" ./bin/wineprefixcreate --snapshot
```

## Adding a Source Plugin

## Unity Integration

### Setting up the projects

First create a new Wwise project, add a Source plugin to a game object, create an Event to trigger it and add it to a Soundbank.

Then create a new Unity project, add the Wwise Unity integration package, reference your Wwise authoring application and previously created project.

Add an empty GameObject to your scene, add an AKBank and AKEvent object and initialise them with ones created in your Wwise project.

After following the instructions below to install the plugin, make sure your soundbanks have been generated and press play in the Unity editor.

### Windows 32bit
From the `Wwise Windows 32bit` target take the following file:

* `HV_{PATCH_NAME}_WwiseSourcePlugin.dll`

And place it in the following directory:

* `{UNITY_PROJECT}/Assets/Wwise/Deployment/Plugins/Windows/x86/DSP/`

### Windows 64bit
From the `Wwise Windows 64bit` target take the following file:

* `HV_{PATCH_NAME}_WwiseSourcePlugin.dll`

And place it in the following directory:

* `{UNITY_PROJECT}/Assets/Wwise/Deployment/Plugins/Windows/x86_64/DSP/`

### Mac OSX
From the `Wwise macOS 64bit` target take the following file from the `/osx/x86_64/Release/` directory:

* `libHV_{PATCH_NAME}_WwiseSourcePlugin.bundle`

And place it in the following directory:

* `{UNITY_PROJECT}/Assets/Wwise/Deployment/Plugins/Mac/DSP/`

*Note: the Mac OSX builds are 64bit only.*

### iOS
From the `Wwise iOS armv7a` target take the downloaded files:

* `libHV_{PATCH_NAME}_WwiseSourcePluginFactory.h`
* `libHV_{PATCH_NAME}_WwiseSourcePlugin.a`

And place it in the following directory:

* `{UNITY_PROJECT}/Assets/Wwise/Deployment/Plugins/iOS/DSP/`
