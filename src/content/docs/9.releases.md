#Â Stable Releases
---

Heavy is constantly being developed and refined, though changes in the internal function or public API may not be suitable or desirable at all points in the application development. New releases are published on a roughly monthly basis and are generally named after the date of release, e.g. `r2016.07.05`.

If a specific release is not indicated when submitting a patch, the most recent stable release will be used. See the [Uploader Documentation](#3.uploader#stable-releases) for how to request a specific release using the uploader.

A `dev` release is always available which contains the most recent version of Heavy. It may contain bugs or errors.

The current list of public releases is available at [https://enzienaudio.com/a/releases](https://enzienaudio.com/a/releases) which returns a JSON object suitable for automated parsing. Stable releases will not be deprecated before the date indicated and are generally available for six months.

All static files for each release are available at [https://github.com/enzienaudio/heavy/releases](https://github.com/enzienaudio/heavy/releases).
