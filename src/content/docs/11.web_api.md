# Web API
---

**heavy** provides a RESTful API to access, edit, upload files and download targets from https://enzienaudio.com

## Schema
API requests should be sent to the following route:
```
https://enzienaudio.com/a/
```

Certain areas of the site require authentication to complete the request, an example header would look like:
```
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdGFydERhdGUiOiIyMDE3LTAxLTA5VDE5OjM3OjAxLjkzNDQxOCIsIm5hbWUiOiJKb2huIERvZSJ9.TXpIAwqmTbcTJnpnFDX-k1to09ixqRZv33U4LO8NNP8
X-Heavy-Service-Token: eyJhbGciOiAiSFMyNTYiLCAidHlwIjogIkpXVCJ9.eyJzdGFydERhdGUiOiAiMjAxNi0xMi0xNVQyMzoyNToxMC4wOTU2MjIiLCAic2VydmljZSI6ICJoZWF2eV91cGxvYWRlciJ9.w2o1_RttJUAiq6WyN0J7MhDsaSseISzgDAQ9aP9Di6M=
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
```

* The `Authorisation:` field is "Bearer " + the user's personal token.
* The `X-Heavy-Service-Token` field is optional and should contain the service token.

JSON Error messages are returned back are formatted in the following way
```json
// Example unauthorised access error
{
    "errors": [{
        "status": "401",
        "detail": "You are not authorised to make this request. Please login or provide access credentials."
    }]
}
```

## Tokens

**heavy** uses [JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io) for authenticating certain requests to the site.

### User tokens

[User tokens](#02.getting_started#tokens) are uniquely tied to your personal account and can be generated through the settings area. Feel free to generate/revoke as many as needed, but make sureyou only provide them to trusted services as it does provide access to private patches and edit capabilities.

### Service tokens

Service tokens are used by registered third-party systems for identification and providing more information about specific sets of users.

If you are interested in developing a third-party system and require a service token please get in touch [info@enzienaudio.com](mailto:info@enzienaudio.com).
