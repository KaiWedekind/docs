# VST
Heavy can generate a VST 2.4 plugin from your patch. It can be either a synth (output-only) or an effect (input and output), supports an arbitrary number of parameters, and can process midi events. In addition to source code, Heavy will also build a universal 32/64-bit OSX VST, or a 64-bit Windows VST DLL for you.

## Defining Parameters
All `[receive]` and `[r]` objects annotated with `@hv_param` will be exposed as VST parameters where the name provided will propagate through to the plugin interface. For example, `[r gain @hv_param 0 1 0.5]` will show up as "gain", with a minimum value of 0, a maximum value of 1, and a default value of 0.5. Note that the VST standard allows a maximum of 8 characters for any parameter name. Receivers with longer names will appear truncated in the DAW interface.

Receivers not annotated with `@hv_param` are still completely functional, they simply will not be exported to the VST interface.

## MIDI Control
In order to receive MIDI note on and off events, as well as control change messages, the `[notein]` and `[ctlin]` objects should be used, respectively.

## Notes
* The `[notein]` object is the only supported means of receiving MIDI note events (i.e. Note On and Note Off). Arguments to the object (e.g. to specify the channel number) will be ignored.
* The `[ctlin]` object is the only supported means of receiving MIDI control change events. Arguments to the object (e.g. to filter which CC event is delivered) will be ignored.
* If you are compiling from source, make sure to read the included `README.md` file in the root directory.
