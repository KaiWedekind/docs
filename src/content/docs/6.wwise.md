# Wwise

## RTPCs
All [receive] and [r] objects annotated with `@hv_param` will be exposed as RTPCs within Wwise where the name provided will propagate through to the plugin interface. For example, `[r gain @hv_param 0 1 0.5]` will show up as "gain", with a minimum value of 0, a maximum value of 1, and a default value of 0.5. All three range values must be given, or they will default to 0, 1, and 0.5 respectively.

Receivers not annotated with `@hv_param` are still completely functional, they simply will not be exposed publicly.

See the patch below for an example simple oscillator with frequency and gain parameters:

## Plugin Assets

### Authoring
The Authoring plugin is what shows up in the Wwise Authoring interface, you can assign this plugin to Sound SFX objects and hook up RTPCs to its parameters.

### Runtime
The runtime components are used by the Wwise integration engine, these are the files that will be actually used by your game or application. We provide both a dynamic plugin that can be easily loaded into development engines like Unity and Unreal, as well a static library that can be compiled directly into the Wwise Integration.

## Installation

### Windows Authoring:
---
Take the following files found in the Wwise Win 64bit or 32bit targets:

* `HV\_{PATCH_NAME}\_WwiseSourceAuthPlugin.dll`
* `HV\_{PATCH_NAME}\_WwiseSourceAuthPlugin.xml`

And copy them to one of the following locations:

* `(64bit) C:\Program Files (x86)\Audiokinetic\Wwise 2016.1.0.5775\Authoring\x64\Release\bin\plugins`

* `(32bit) C:\Program Files (x86)\Audiokinetic\Wwise 2016.1.0.5775\Authoring\Win32\Release\bin\plugins`

### Mac OSX Authoring:
---

The Wwise Authoring application for Mac OSX uses a Wine wrapper and therefore requires plugin binaries compiled for Windows. Take the following files found in the Wwise Win 32bit target:

* `HV\_{PATCH_NAME}\_WwiseSourceAuthPlugin.dll`
* `HV\_{PATCH_NAME}\_WwiseSourceAuthPlugin.xml`

And copy them to the following location:

* `/Applications/Audiokinetic/Wwise 2016.1.0.5775/Wwise.app/Contents/SharedSupport/Wwise2016/support/wwise/drive_c/Program Files/Audiokinetic/Wwise/Authoring/Win32/Release/bin/plugins/`

After installing the plugins the Wine cache will need to be refreshed, in a command-line application like Terminal:

```
$ cd "/Applications/Audiokinetic/Wwise 2016.1.0.5775/Wwise.app/Contents/SharedSupport/Wwise2016/"

$ CX_ROOT="/Applications/Audiokinetic/Wwise 2016.1.0.5775/Wwise.app/Contents/SharedSupport/Wwise2016/" WINEPREFIX="/Applications/Audiokinetic/Wwise 2016.1.0.5775/Wwise.app/Contents/SharedSupport/Wwise2016/support/wwise/" ./bin/wineprefixcreate --snapshot
```
## Adding a Source Plugin

## Sending Messages Out

## Unity Integration

First create a new Wwise project, add a Source plugin to a game object, create an Event to trigger it and add it to a Soundbank.

Then create a new Unity project, add the Wwise Unity integration package, reference your Wwise authoring application and previously created project.

Add an empty GameObject to your scene, add an AKBank and AKEvent object and initialise them with ones created in your Wwise project.

After following the instructions below to install the plugin, make sure your soundbanks have been generated and press play in the Unity editor.

### Windows:
---
From the Wwise Win 32bit or 64bit targets take the following file:

* **HV\_{PATCH_NAME}\_WwiseSourceRuntimePlugin.dll**

And place it in the following directory:

* **{UNITY_PROJECT}/Assets/Wwise/Deployment/Plugins/Mac/DSP/**


### Mac OSX:
---

From the Wwise OSX/iOS target take the following file from the '/osx/x86_64/Release' directory:

* **HV\_{PATCH_NAME}\_WwiseSourceRuntimePlugin.bundle**

And place it in the following directory:

* **{UNITY_PROJECT}/Assets/Wwise/Deployment/Plugins/Mac/DSP/**
